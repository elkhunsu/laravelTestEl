Start the Queue Worker:
Run the queue worker to start processing the queued jobs:

php artisan queue:work

This command will start processing the queued jobs using the Redis queue connection.

With these steps, when a comment creation is dispatched, it will be added to the Redis queue and processed asynchronously by the queue worker. This helps improve the responsiveness of your application by moving time-consuming tasks like comment creation outside the main request lifecycle.

php artisan migrate

php artisan db:seed

php artisan serve
